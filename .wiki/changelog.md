## 2026-04-29 — Generation Page Guided UX and Readiness Audit Pass

### Files Changed

- `src/pages/Generator.tsx`
- `.wiki/index.md`
- `.wiki/changelog.md`

### Verified UI Changes in `src/pages/Generator.tsx`

- Re-audited the generation page and strengthened the existing task-oriented creation flow with more familiar guided-creation patterns for non-technical users.
- Replaced the single flat prompt-example row with grouped prompt starter tabs:
  - `Quick starts`
  - `Characters`
  - `Products`
- Added multiple starter prompts per group so users can begin from recognizable examples instead of writing from a blank canvas.
- Added a visible prompt strength/guide indicator showing how many helpful prompt details are currently included.
- Added a collapsible writing-help checklist for:
  - `Subject`
  - `Style`
  - `Mood`
  - `Details`
- Added dynamic workflow state handling so the four-step strip can reflect current progress across `Describe`, `Choose style`, `Generate`, and `Review`.
- Added a quick-route shortcut strip for `Write prompt`, `Choose style`, `Open history`, and readiness status.
- Added a generation readiness checklist for `Signed in`, `Style selected`, `Prompt added`, and `Online`.
- Updated the primary create button logic and copy so disabled states explain the blocking condition:
  - offline users see `Reconnect to create`.
  - signed-out users see `Sign in to create`.
  - users without a selected style see `Choose a style first`.
  - users without prompt text see `Describe your image first`.
- Updated generation submission gating so the page only calls `generate(cleanPrompt)` when prompt text, sign-in, selected style, online status, and non-generating status are all ready.
- Updated selected-style helper copy to mention available styles when no style is selected.
- Expanded the preview header with readiness/status badges.
- Expanded the loading state with familiar progress cues: `Checking prompt`, `Applying style`, and `Saving result`.
- Expanded the empty preview state with direct actions to write a prompt or choose a style.
- Added a `Not sure where to start?` helper box in the prompt guide card.
- Reworked responsive CSS for the added shortcut strip, prompt guide, prompt example tabs, readiness checklist, and preview badges.

### Architecture Notes

- Affected layer: UI page composition in `src/pages/Generator.tsx`.
- Existing backend generation behavior remains delegated to the existing `generate` function from `LiteContext`.
- Existing routes are reused for navigation: `/`, `/profile`, and `/auth`.
- The prompt checklist and grouped starters are presentation guidance only; they do not alter backend prompts, model selection, moderation, billing, Firebase, Electron, Domain, or Core behavior.
- No new dependencies were introduced.

### Verification Evidence

- `npm exec tsc -- --noEmit --pretty false` completed without reported TypeScript errors after the `src/pages/Generator.tsx` changes.
- `npm run build` completed successfully after the `src/pages/Generator.tsx` changes, producing Vite production output for the app bundle plus Electron main and preload bundles.

## 2026-04-29 — Full-Width Profile and History UX Audit Pass

### Files Changed

- `src/pages/UserProfile.tsx`
- `.wiki/index.md`
- `.wiki/changelog.md`

### Verified UI Changes in `src/pages/UserProfile.tsx`

- Replaced the previous narrow atmospheric profile/archive page with a full-width profile and history dashboard.
- Added a clear page header with breadcrumb context: `Studio / Profile & history`.
- Added plain-language page copy explaining that users can manage their account, review local history, and continue creating.
- Added quick navigation actions for `Create image`, `Choose style`, and `Sign out`.
- Replaced atmospheric account language with clearer labels:
  - `Creator level`
  - `Images created`
  - `Current level`
  - `Local history`
  - `System status`
- Added a full-width account overview with user identity, creator-level progress, next milestone copy, and benefit pills.
- Added a dashboard stat grid for total images, current level, images with style info, and local history status.
- Reworked the history area into a dedicated `Your image history` workspace.
- Added search with placeholder text for prompts, image IDs, and style IDs.
- Added visible result counts with `Showing X of Y images`.
- Added filter tabs for `All images`, `Recent`, and `With style info`.
- Added a no-results state with a clear search/filter reset action.
- Added an empty-history state with direct actions to `Create image` and `Choose style`.
- Reworked history cards so prompt text, save date, image ID, and style ID metadata are visible without relying on hover.
- Improved image alt text by using prompt text when available.
- Reworked diagnostics into a secondary `System status` panel with clearer labels:
  - `Local history database`
  - `Desktop app version`
  - `Build type`
- Reworked responsive CSS so the full-width dashboard collapses into tablet and mobile layouts.

### Architecture Notes

- Affected layer: UI page composition in `src/pages/UserProfile.tsx`.
- Existing profile/history data contract remains intact: `currentUser`, `logout`, `localHistory`, and `addToast` are still sourced from `useLite()`.
- Existing tier display source remains intact: `calculateTier()` and `USER_TIERS` are still used for creator-level display.
- Existing optional system status contract remains intact: the page still calls `window.electronAPI.lite.health()` when available.
- Search and filters are presentational UI behavior over existing `localHistory`; no persistence, backend, Electron, Domain, or Core behavior was modified.

### Verification Evidence

- `npm exec tsc -- --noEmit --pretty false` completed without reported errors.
- `npm run build` completed successfully with Vite production output for app, Electron main, and Electron preload bundles.

## 2026-04-29 — Model Selection UX and Navigation Audit Pass

### Files Changed

- `src/pages/ModelFeed.tsx`
- `.wiki/index.md`
- `.wiki/changelog.md`

### Verified UI Changes in `src/pages/ModelFeed.tsx`

- Replaced the previous immersive engine gallery with a more familiar style-picker workflow.
- Added a clear page header with breadcrumb context: `Explore / Choose style`.
- Added plain-language page copy explaining that users are choosing the look for their next image and can change it before generating.
- Added quick navigation actions for `Create image` and `History` using existing application routes.
- Added a current-choice summary panel that shows the selected model when present, recommends a starting style when no model is selected, and provides a clear continuation CTA.
- Added beginner-friendly guidance chips explaining when to choose realistic, illustration/anime, or recommended beginner styles.
- Added a searchable style library with a visible count showing how many styles are currently displayed.
- Added category filter tabs for `All styles`, `Best for beginners`, `Realistic`, `Illustration`, and `Creative`.
- Added empty states for both loading models and no matching search/filter results, including a clear reset action for empty search results.
- Reworked model cards to use clearer terminology:
  - `Use this style` as the primary action.
  - `Selected` and `Recommended` badges.
  - Plain-language style labels such as `Photo style`, `Art style`, `Creative`, and `Recommended`.
  - `Best for:` guidance derived from existing model metadata and model text.
- Preserved whole-card selection while adding keyboard accessibility through `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, and Enter/Space handling.
- Reworked responsive CSS so the page collapses from multi-column desktop browsing to simpler tablet/mobile layouts.

### Architecture Notes

- Affected layer: UI page composition in `src/pages/ModelFeed.tsx`.
- Existing model data contract remains intact: `availableModels`, `selectedModel`, `setSelectedModel`, and `currentUser` are still sourced from `useLite()`.
- Existing selection behavior remains intact: `lite_selected_model` is still written to `localStorage`; authenticated users continue to `/generate`; unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth`.
- Model categorization is presentational decision support only and is derived locally from existing `AIModel` name/description and `getModelMetadata()` output.
- No Domain, Core, Firebase, Electron, or backend generation behavior was modified.

### Verification Evidence

- `npm exec tsc -- --noEmit --pretty false` completed without reported errors.
- `npm run build` completed successfully with Vite production output for app, Electron main, and Electron preload bundles.

- Business generation behavior remains delegated to the existing `generate` function from `LiteContext`.

### Verification Evidence

- `npm exec tsc -- --noEmit --pretty false` completed without reported errors.
